# Introduction

## Speech understanding  

- Cochlear implant (CI) listeners often understand speech well in quiet but poorly in the presence of noise.

- Commercial CIs convey both spectral (electrode position) and temporal cues (envelope modulations) by means of symmetric biphasic electrical pulses.

- Poor performance can be partially explained by the **limited number of independent channels** <font size="3"> (up to 7 or 8, e.g. Holmes et al., Friesen et al., 2001) </font> but also due to **poor electrode-neuron interface** <font size="3"> (Pfingst et al., 2008; Bierer and Faulkner, 2010). </font>

- Both, **spectral and temporal** cues are largely affected by current spread.

## Why is this important? 

- Poor **electrode discrimination**, particularly in the apical and mid array, is associated with **poor speech perception** <font size="3"> (Zhang et al. 2019, Busby et al., 2000; Dawson et al., 2000; Henry et al., 2000) </font>

<!-- - Strong relationship between eACC and behavioural electrode discrimination (Mathew et al. 2017, 2018). -->

- Temporal cues, in particular, **modulation detection thresholds (MDTs)** are associated with consonant and vowel recognition <font size="3">(Fu, 2002)</font>, intonation recognition <font size="3"> (Chatterjee et al. 2008) </font>, and to word recognition and **speech reception thresholds** <font size="3"> (Won et al., 2011) </font>

- **Deactivation of electrodes in regions of poor electrode-neuron interface** is associeted to **improved performance** <font size="3"> (eg. Zhou 2019, Saleh et al., 2013; Zwolan et al., 1997). </font>

- Strong correlation between MDT and current spread has been reported <font size="3"> (Zhou et al. 2018) </font>



## Why Objective measures?

- There is a need to objectively identify poor electrode-neuron interface channels to optimize performance in CI listeners.
- Psychophysical measurements of discrimination depend on attention, cognition and linguistic ability.
- Psychophysical measurements are limited to older children and adults.


## Objective measures of spectral processing
- Recently our group has been using the electrically-evoked acoustic change complex (eACC) <font size="3">(e.g. Mathew et al. 2017, 2018) </font> to assess independency of electrode pairs in CI listeners.
- This is carried out by loudness balancing stimulating electrodes and measuring the eACC to a **change of electrode**.

<!-- ## Objective measures of temporal processing -->

<!-- - Electrically-evoked auditory steady-state responses (eASSR) (e.g. Luke et al. 2015) are an alternative. However, these are usually obatined either at lower stimulation rates or narrow electrode configurations to prevent artifact contamination.  -->

<!-- - An alternative is to use the electrically-evoked acoustics change complex (eACC), with the caveat the all stimuli must be loudness balanced to prevent loudness cues. -->


# Aims

<center> 
![](./my_figures/ci_env_dic_slow_time_domain.png){width="60%"}

- Reliable responses were observed at high pulse rates.
- 6/6 behavioural discrimination scores were significant


<!-- ## Results eACC (7Hz) -->

<!-- ![](./my_figures/ci_env_fast_time_freq_domain.png) -->

## Summary

- Clear and reliable responses can be obtained using a continuous eACC paradigm (0.5 Hz) to electrode or AM changes. 

- NH listeners showed clear ACC and steady-state responses to AM frequency changes with a rapid response reduction at 50%. 

- CI responses to lower pulse rates were more variable but still clear at both 50% and 100% modulation depth. 

- All CI participants showed good responses for slow switching rates but not for the high switching rate. This may suggest adaptation effects.

- eACC responses to 800 pps did not change in amplitude when the modulation depth was reduced from 100% and 50%.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

- Thank you and all participants.
